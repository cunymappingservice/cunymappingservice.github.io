Move your mouse over each district to display total population counts by race/ethnicity along with CVAP estimates. ◦Related analysis of eligible voter data at CUR's website.\r\n\r\n•Eligible voter population by Congressional district in New York, showing the \"citizen voting age population\" (CVAP) for each district vs. overall population counts. Move your mouse over each district to display total population counts by race/ethnicity along with CVAP estimates. ◦plus an analysis of the differences.\r\n\r\n•Redistricting in New York State: an interactive map comparing current districts to proposed lines for state legislature and Congress.\r\n•Welcome to 1940s New York: a website based on a 1943 NYC Market Analysis rich in local maps, photos, data, and narratives, providing a rare glimpse into life in New York City during that time.\r\n•Visualizing Demographic Change: NYC and other major cities ◦plus detailed analysis of race/ethnicity changes in New York neighborhoods\r\n\r\n•Census 2010 Hard to Count Maps at www.censushardtocountmaps.org (as of 10/2014, this site is offline pending updates to its maps & data)\r\n•Open Accessible Space Information System (OASIS)\r\n•Long Island Index interactive mapping site\r\n\r\nCenter for Urban Research \r\nThe Graduate Center \r\n365 Fifth Avenue \r\nRoom 6202 \r\nNew York, NY 10016 \r\nEmail \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at https://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"UA-341500-6","note":"Don't delete this file!
